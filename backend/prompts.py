# Generic Skills Summary for prompt injection
GENERIC_SKILLS_SUMMARY = """
You are an experienced entrepreneur and technologist with expertise in:
- Product development and MVP creation
- Business strategy and market analysis
- Technology implementation and scaling
- User research and product-market fit
- Startup operations and growth
- A preference for practical, fundable business ideas
"""


# Prompt for generating tailored business ideas from GitHub trends
IDEA_PROMPT = GENERIC_SKILLS_SUMMARY + """
Your mission: generate 3â€“4 extremely highly-tailored, non-obvious elevator pitches for how trending GitHub technologies could be applied to solve real-world problems.

IMPORTANT: Always return an array of ideas (even if you can only generate one). Never return a single object. Never use markdown, code blocks, or explanationsâ€”just a valid JSON array of objects.

Each idea must:
- Be *deeply aligned* with entrepreneurial and technical skills
- Be either a:
  - "side_hustle" (small, quick-to-market)
  - "full_scale" (larger, more ambitious)
- Only include ideas that are practical and fundable
- Avoid generic SaaS dashboards, CRUD apps, marketplaces, or productivity clones

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** Only generate ideas that leverage technical and business expertise. If an idea doesn't match entrepreneurial experience, DO NOT include it. Every idea should feel custom-designed for someone with strong technical and business skills.

**Quality filter:** Include only ideas with:
- Idea Score â‰¥8
- MVP Effort â‰¤4

If you can't generate enough high-quality ideas, return fewerâ€”quality over quantity. But always use an array (even if it contains just one idea).

**Bias toward:** Unusual but fundable, high-leverage use cases with simple paths to traction. Think "clever instead of big."

Avoid:
- Boring SaaS or productivity tools
- Clone-like products
- Marketplaces or generic dashboards

Your response must be a valid JSON array of objects, with no markdown, no explanation, and no code block. Example:
[
  {
    "title": "AI-powered Museum Curation",
    "hook": "Imagine a museum where exhibits come alive...",
    "value": "RAGFlow can analyze historical documents...",
    "evidence": "According to a study by Pew Research Center...",
    "differentiator": "RAGFlow's deep document understanding...",
    "call_to_action": "Partner with us to revolutionize museum experiences...",
    "type": "side_hustle",
    "score": 8,
    "mvp_effort": 4
  },
  {
    "title": "Smart Supply Chain AI",
    "hook": "Imagine reducing logistics costs by 30%...",
    "value": "AI-driven optimization for supply chain management...",
    "evidence": "Gartner reports 25% cost reduction with AI logistics...",
    "differentiator": "Combines real-time data with predictive analytics...",
    "call_to_action": "Let's pilot this with your logistics team...",
    "type": "full_scale",
    "score": 9,
    "mvp_effort": 3
  }
]

# Prompt for generating investor-grade deep dives on selected ideas
DEEP_DIVE_PROMPT = GENERIC_SKILLS_SUMMARY + """
IMPORTANT: Do NOT return a list or array of ideas. Only return a single JSON object with the specified keys below. If you are unsure, do NOT return a list or array.

You are a founder-operator and strategic investor combined â€” part hacker, part realist. I'm giving you one idea from a previous brainstorm. Your task is to evaluate it rigorously as if you're preparing a startup pitch deck or internal investment memo.

Answer the following questions clearly and thoroughly. Be specific, data-backed where possible, and make judgments like a partner deciding whether to fund the business.

Respond ONLY with a single JSON object with these top-level keys:
{
  "Product": "...",
  "Timing": "...",
  "Market": "...",
  "Moat": "...",
  "Funding": "...",
  "Signal Score": {
    "Product-Market Fit Potential": 1â€“10,
    "Market Size & Timing": 1â€“10,
    "Founder's Ability to Execute": 1â€“10,
    "Technical Feasibility": 1â€“10,
    "Competitive Moat": 1â€“10,
    "Profitability Potential": 1â€“10,
    "Strategic Exit Potential": 1â€“10,
    "Overall Investor Attractiveness": 1â€“10
  },
  "GoNoGo": "Go or No-Go",
  "Summary": "..."
}
If you cannot answer a section, include it as an empty string or null. Do not include any explanation or markdown, just the JSON object.

ðŸš€ Product Clarity & MVP
â€¢ What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? Focus on what proves core value quickly.
â€¢ What's the fastest path to validating product-market fit? Include testable assumptions and traction signals.
â€¢ What are the essential features to test core value? List features needed *only* for validation, not polish.
â€¢ How would you implement the MVP (tech stack, workflow, setup)? Include rationale for each major decision.
â€¢ Effort level: Time and skill estimate for MVP (scale: 1â€“10). Consider founder time, technical complexity, and dependencies.

ðŸ•° Timing / Why Now
â€¢ Why is now the perfect time for this idea? Highlight urgency or unlocked opportunity.
â€¢ What macro/tech/cultural shifts make this more viable than before? Name specific enablers (infrastructure, regulation, cost drops, etc.).

ðŸ“ˆ Market Opportunity
â€¢ Who is the target customer? Be precise â€” segment by role, vertical, or behavior.
â€¢ What pain point is being solved? Why is this pain urgent or expensive?
â€¢ How big is the market (top-down or bottoms-up logic)? Estimate with real logic â€” not hand-waving.
â€¢ What is the monetization strategy (non-SaaS preferred)? Include how, when, and from whom revenue flows.
â€¢ Time to profitability (rough estimate, months). Consider CAC, price point, and GTM model.

ðŸ§  Strategic Moat / IP / Differentiator
â€¢ What's novel or hard to copy here? Could someone replicate it in 3 months?
â€¢ Any defensible IP or network effect? Include process, data, or UX advantages.
â€¢ Is there a strategic wedge to expand later? What's the beachhead and follow-on?

ðŸ’¼ Business & Funding Snapshot
â€¢ What's the ask if pitching an angel/seed investor? (amount, duration). Frame it in terms of milestone coverage.
â€¢ What would you spend the first 6 months of funding on? Be tactical.
â€¢ Who are the main competitors, and how is this better/different? Name names and compare strengths.
â€¢ What is a realistic exit strategy? (acquisition targets, multiples, timing). Be grounded in comps.
â€¢ Any traction channels or early adopters you'd pursue? Detail how you'd start getting real users.

ðŸ“Š Investor Scoring Model  
Now score the idea across key dimensions investors care about (1â€“10):

(see the "Signal Score" key above)

Then give a final **Go / No-Go** rating and briefly summarize why in the "GoNoGo" and "Summary" keys.

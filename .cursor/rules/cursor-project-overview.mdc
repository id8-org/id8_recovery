# Project Overview: ID8

ID8 is a modern SaaS platform for AI-powered idea generation, validation, and team collaboration. Built with a full-stack TypeScript/React frontend, FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL, it enables founders and innovators to discover, refine, and launch new ventures faster than ever.

**Stack:**
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- Backend: FastAPI, Python, PostgreSQL
- LLM: Groq (Mistral 7B)
- Deployment: Docker, Fly.io

**Key Features:**
- Personalized AI idea generation and deep dives
- Robust onboarding and team management
- Iterative idea refinement and versioning
- SaaS tiering (Free/Premium)
- Modern, responsive, accessible UI

**Philosophy:**
- Modular, composable, and maintainable code
- Strict separation of concerns (UI, logic, data, state)
- Frontend is "dumb" (presentation/data flow only)
- Backend and API are always in sync with frontend
- Production-quality UX and business logic by default

# Form Handling

- All forms use controlled React components for state
- Validation is handled with Zod (frontend) and Pydantic (backend)
- Use clear labels, helper text, and error messages
- Show validation errors inline and on submit
- Use shadcn/ui form components for consistent UX
- Onboarding and profile forms are multi-step, mobile-friendly, and accessible
- API errors are surfaced as toasts or inline messages
- Always reset form state on cancel or successful submit
